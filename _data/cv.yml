aboutme: I am currently finishing my double bachelor’s degree on computer science and telecommunications systems at Mondragon University.  At this institution I have developed both my technical and interpersonal skills thought the Project Oriented Problem Based Learning (POPBL) methodology. I have also collaborated part time with a group of professors in the facilities of the university in the field of industrial automation through robotics, artificial vision and AI. I have found this latter fields of study of great interest and I intend to further my knowledge on them. I consider myself an eager learner and a committed person both to my personal development and to the interests of the teams I am a part of.
